## 💼 About Me

I am a versatile and hands-on problem solver who thrives at the intersection of tech and real-world impact. Through my internship at a legal tech startup and projects like a clinician time tracker and educator resource hub, I have worked across both front-end and back-end technologies to ship real results.

I also founded **Ellipsis**, an early-stage startup dedicated to helping small businesses create a meaningful online presence.
